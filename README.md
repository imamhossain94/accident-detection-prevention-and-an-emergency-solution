## Accident Detection Prevention and an Emergency Solution (ADPES)

Road accidents have become a significant concern in Bangladesh, with high-speed driving and unaware drivers being the primary factors in road accidents. Increasing vehicle use has resulted in increased traffic disorder, which has increased the number of road accidents. In the event of an accident, some people are unable to reach the hospital on time due to traffic jams, lack of ambulance, and lack of necessary information. Here is an automated Internet of Things (IoT) based accident prevention, detection, and emergency solution. The system is designed to send signals to the nearest hospital in case of an accident. It detects whether a driver has consumed alcohol or not. If the sensor detects alcohol, The car will automatically stop until the smell is gone. It also detects when the driver is asleep due to the ride and triggers the buzzer sound. When the car detects an object nearly 30 cm. away, it will stop moving. When an accident occurs, the system will send the accident location to the nearest hospital through SMS.
