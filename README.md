## Accident Detection Prevention and an Emergency Solution (ADPES)

Road accidents have become a significant concern in Bangladesh, with high-speed driving and unaware drivers being the primary factors in road accidents. Increasing vehicle use has resulted in increased traffic disorder, which has increased the number of road accidents. In the event of an accident, some people are unable to reach the hospital on time due to traffic jams, lack of ambulance, and lack of necessary information. Here is an automated Internet of Things (IoT) based accident prevention, detection, and emergency solution. The system is designed to send signals to the nearest hospital in case of an accident. It detects whether a driver has consumed alcohol or not. If the sensor detects alcohol, The car will automatically stop until the smell is gone. It also detects when the driver is asleep due to the ride and triggers the buzzer sound. When the car detects an object nearly 30 cm. away, it will stop moving. When an accident occurs, the system will send the accident location to the nearest hospital through SMS.

## Feature

:heavy_check_mark: Accident Detection
:heavy_check_mark: Accident Prevention
:heavy_check_mark: Emergency Solution

## How Does It Works

* Accident Prevention
    ```
    To Prevent accident we used four sensor
    * Ultrasonic:  When the sensor detects an object nearly 30 cm it will stop the car.
    * PIR: It is used to monitor the driver motion. If the driver moved out from its range the car will stop immediately.
    * MQ3: Checking whether the driver is alcoholic or not.
    * Bazzer: When the PIR sensor detects that the driver is in a sleep, It will make noise.
    ```
* Accident Detection
    ```
    To Detect an accident we used only one sensor
    * Vibrator sensor: If the car crash, it will produce a signal. Based on the signal we do an emergency solution.
    ```
* Emergency Solution
    ```
    In Emergency solution we used some modules and a server
    * GPS NEO 6M: Get car current location in Latitude and Longitude.
    * SIM 800L: Do a post request with Latitude and Longitude and then send an SMS into the responsed phone number.
    * Server: The server calculate the sortest path between hospitals and the accident occured location and return hospital details as response.
    ```
